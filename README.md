# Code of alura course and my annotations

## to create this  template type in terminal

`````gcc
npx create-react-app alura-reactJs
`````

cool thing about this is: automatic initialize a git repo

## to start my application in dev mode run

```gcc
yarn start
```

in alura video he uses "npm start", but in my case is yarn start, and i don't now why.

It's nice to remember that react come with hot reload.

## Useful stuff

NPM - Manages packages but doesn't make life easy executing any.

NPX - A tool for executing Node packages.
